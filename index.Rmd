### About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the lab of [James Gusella](https://cgm.massgeneral.org/faculty/james-gusella/) at the Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School

My expertise is in using genetic technologies to understand development and diseases. I'm currently working on identifying genetic factors that affect CAG repeat instability in Huntington's disease. This involves developing reporters for CAG length and genetic perturbations of in vitro models, including human pluripotent stem cells.
